This is a simple script to fetch server details for a dedicated American Truck Simulator convoy server and display information to Discord via a Webhook.
I'm still very early in my dev journey, at the stage I've created this I'm learning Python, not Javascript, so while I added some lines myself, most are generated by AI for the time being.
I might rewrite this in .py at a later date

Notes: This is set up to read some of its information from a .env file
